By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.</p> <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p> <p>Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</p> <p>A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.</p> <p>The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version.</p> <p>An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.</p> <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>"},{"location":"LICENSE/#terms-and-conditions","title":"TERMS AND CONDITIONS","text":""},{"location":"LICENSE/#0-definitions","title":"0.

HOT is committed to providing a welcoming and safe environment for people of all races, gender identities, gender expressions, sexual orientations, physical abilities, physical appearances, socio-economic backgrounds, nationalities, ages, religions, and beliefs.</p> <p>The HOT community principles are:</p> <ul> <li>Be friendly and patient. Be generous and kind in both giving and accepting   critique. Critique is a natural and important part of our culture. Good   critiques are kind, respectful, clear, and constructive, focused on goals and   requirements rather than personal preferences. You are expected to give and   receive criticism with grace. Be considerate in speech and actions, and   actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow attendees.</li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports   people of all backgrounds and identities. Some examples of behavior that   contributes to creating a positive environment include:</p> <ul> <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Showing empathy towards other community members.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Placing collective interest before your own interest.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn   will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and   colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making   decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be   communicating in someone else's primary language.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is   no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some   frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a   personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel   uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the HOT   community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with   people outside the HOT community.</li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Be careful in your word choice. We are a global community of   professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do   not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary   behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:</p> <ul> <li>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Discriminatory jokes and language.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying   information (\"doxing\").</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then   stop.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Assume all communications are positive. Always remain polite, and assume   good faith. It is surprisingly easy to misunderstand each other, be it online   or in person, particularly in such a culturally diverse setting as ours.   Misunderstandings are particularly easy to arise when we are in a rush, or   otherwise distracted. Please ask clarifying questions before assuming that a   communication was inappropriate.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and   technical, happen easily and often. It is important that we resolve such   disagreements and differing views constructively. At times it can be hard to   appreciate a viewpoint that contradicts your own perceptions. Instead of pushing   back, try to understand where the other person is coming from, and don't be   afraid to ask questions. You can be most helpful if your own replies serve to   clarify, rather than to escalate an issue. Also don't forget that it can be   easy to make mistakes, and allow for the possibility that the mistake may have   been yours. When this happens it is better to resolve the issue together, and   to learn from the experience together, than to place blame.</li> </ul> <p>Original text courtesy of the Speak Up! project.</p> <p>Further sources:</p> <ul> <li>Ada Initiative: HOWTO design a code of conduct for your community</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Algorithm Club Code of Conduct</li> </ul> <ul> <li>American Red Cross GIS Team Code of Conduct</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Contributor Covenant \u2013 A Code of Conduct for Open Source Projects</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Django Code of Conduct</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Vox Media Code of Conduct</li> </ul>"},{"location":"code-of-conduct/#complaint-handling-process","title":"Complaint Handling Process","text":"<p>As a first measure, it is preferable to work out issues directly with the people involved, or to work with other Community Members who can help you resolve the issue.
